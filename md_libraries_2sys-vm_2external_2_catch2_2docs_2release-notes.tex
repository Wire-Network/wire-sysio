\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}

\doxysubsection*{2.\+3.\+0}

{\bfseries{This release changes the include paths provided by our CMake and pkg-\/config integration. The proper include path for the single-\/header when using one of the above is now {\ttfamily \texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}\doxylink{single__include_2catch2_2catch_8hpp}{catch2/catch.\+hpp}\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}}. This change also necessitated changes to paths inside the repository, so that the single-\/header version is now at {\ttfamily \doxylink{single__include_2catch2_2catch_8hpp}{single\+\_\+include/catch2/catch.\+hpp}}, rather than {\ttfamily single\+\_\+include/catch.\+hpp}.}}

\doxysubsubsection*{Fixes}

\end{DoxyItemize}

\doxysubsubsection*{Improvements}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item pkg-\/config and CMake integration has been rewritten
\begin{DoxyItemize}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item When this is set to {\ttfamily false} and the tests are run without {\ttfamily -\/s}, passing assertions are not sent to the reporter.
\item Defaults to {\ttfamily false}.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Added {\ttfamily DYNAMIC\+\_\+\+SECTION}, a section variant that constructs its name using stream
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item This means that you can do {\ttfamily DYNAMIC\+\_\+\+SECTION("{}\+For X \+:= "{} \texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}\texorpdfstring{$<$}{<} x)}.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}

\doxysubsection*{2.\+2.\+3}

{\bfseries{To fix some of the bugs, some behavior had to change in potentially breaking manner.}} {\bfseries{This means that even though this is a patch release, it might not be a drop-\/in replacement.}}

\item {\bfseries{This has potential to be a breaking change}}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixed compilation error when a type has an {\ttfamily operator\texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}\texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}} with templated lhs (\#1285, \#1306)
\end{DoxyItemize}

\doxysubsubsection*{Improvements}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Added a new, experimental, output capture (\#1243)

\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Added a new fallback stringifier for classes derived from {\ttfamily std\+::exception}

\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Added upper bound on the time benchmark timer calibration is allowed to take (\#1237)
\begin{DoxyItemize}

\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily \doxylink{class_catch_1_1_session_a0232a6c37ad5b5064a2462eedf13a9be}{Catch\+::\+Session\+::run()}} now accepts {\ttfamily char const \texorpdfstring{$\ast$}{*} const \texorpdfstring{$\ast$}{*}}, allowing it to accept array of string literals (\#1031, \#1178)

\doxysubsection*{2.\+1.\+0}

\doxysubsubsection*{Improvements}


\begin{DoxyItemize}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item On top of the performance regression fixes
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Experimental support for PCH was added (\#1061)

\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}

\doxysubsubsection*{Fixes}

\doxysubsubsection*{New features}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item New Matchers
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Regex matcher for strings, {\ttfamily Matches}.
\item Set-\/equal matcher for vectors, {\ttfamily Unordered\+Equals}
\item Floating point matchers, {\ttfamily Within\+Abs} and {\ttfamily Within\+ULP}.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Stringification now attempts to decompose all containers (\#606)
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Containers are objects that respond to ADL {\ttfamily begin(\+T)} and {\ttfamily end(\+T)}.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}

\doxysubsubsection*{Other changes}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Reporters will now be versioned in the {\ttfamily single\+\_\+include} folder to ensure their compatibility with the last released version
\end{DoxyItemize}

\doxysubsection*{2.\+0.\+1}

\doxysubsubsection*{Breaking changes}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Removed C++98 support
\item Removed legacy reporter support
\item Removed legacy generator support
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Generator support will come back later, reworked
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Removed {\ttfamily Catch\+::to\+String} support
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The new stringification machinery uses {\ttfamily \doxylink{struct_catch_1_1_string_maker}{Catch\+::\+String\+Maker}} specializations first and {\ttfamily operator\texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}\texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}} overloads second.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Removed legacy {\ttfamily SCOPED\+\_\+\+MSG} and {\ttfamily SCOPED\+\_\+\+INFO} macros
\item Removed {\ttfamily INTERNAL\+\_\+\+CATCH\+\_\+\+REGISTER\+\_\+\+REPORTER}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily CATCH\+\_\+\+REGISTER\+\_\+\+REPORTER} should be used to register reporters
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Removed legacy {\ttfamily \mbox{[}hide\mbox{]}} tag
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily \mbox{[}.\mbox{]}}, {\ttfamily \mbox{[}.foo\mbox{]}} and {\ttfamily \mbox{[}!hide\mbox{]}} are still supported
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Output into debugger is now colourized
\item {\ttfamily \texorpdfstring{$\ast$}{*}\+\_\+\+THROWS\+\_\+\+AS(expr, exception\+\_\+type)} now unconditionally appends {\ttfamily const\&} to the exception type.
\item {\ttfamily CATCH\+\_\+\+CONFIG\+\_\+\+FAST\+\_\+\+COMPILE} now affects the {\ttfamily CHECK\+\_\+} family of assertions as well as {\ttfamily REQUIRE\+\_\+} family of assertions
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item This is most noticeable in {\ttfamily \doxylink{fc_2secp256k1_2secp256k1_2src_2util_8h_aba1590ff86288c886c47dc8a27b30467}{CHECK(throws())}}, which would previously report failure, properly stringify the exception and continue. Now it will report failure and stop executing current section.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Removed deprecated matcher utility functions {\ttfamily Not}, {\ttfamily All\+Of} and {\ttfamily Any\+Of}.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item They are superseded by operators {\ttfamily !}, {\ttfamily \&\&} and {\ttfamily \texorpdfstring{$\vert$}{|}\texorpdfstring{$\vert$}{|}}, which are natural and do not have limited arity
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Removed support for non-\/const comparison operators
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Non-\/const comparison operators are an abomination that should not exist
\item They were breaking support for comparing function to function pointer
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily std\+::pair} and {\ttfamily std\+::tuple} are no longer stringified by default
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item This is done to avoid dragging in {\ttfamily \texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}tuple\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}} and {\ttfamily \texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}utility\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}} headers in common path
\item Their stringification can be enabled per-\/file via new configuration macros
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily Approx} is subtly different and hopefully behaves more as users would expect
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily Approx\+::scale} defaults to {\ttfamily 0.\+0}
\item {\ttfamily Approx\+::epsilon} no longer applies to the larger of the two compared values, but only to the {\ttfamily Approx}\textquotesingle{}s value
\item {\ttfamily INFINITY == Approx(\+INFINITY)} returns true
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}

\doxysubsubsection*{Improvements}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Reporters and Listeners can be defined in files different from the main file
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The file has to define {\ttfamily CATCH\+\_\+\+CONFIG\+\_\+\+EXTERNAL\+\_\+\+INTERFACES} before including catch.\+hpp.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item \doxylink{namespace_errors}{Errors} that happen during set up before main are now caught and properly reported once main is entered
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item If you are providing your own main, you can access and use these as well.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item New assertion macros, \texorpdfstring{$\ast$}{*}\+\_\+\+THROWS\+\_\+\+MATCHES(expr, exception\+\_\+type, matcher) are provided
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item As the arguments suggest, these allow you to assert that an expression throws desired type of exception and pass the exception to a matcher.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item JUnit reporter no longer has significantly different output for test cases with and without sections
\item Most assertions now support expressions containing commas (ie {\ttfamily REQUIRE(\doxylink{structfoo}{foo()} == std\+::vector\texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}int\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}\{1, 2, 3\});})
\item \doxylink{namespace_catch}{Catch} now contains experimental micro benchmarking support
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item See {\ttfamily projects/\+Self\+Test/\+Benchmark.\+tests.\+cpp} for examples
\item The support being experiment means that it can be changed without prior notice
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item \doxylink{namespace_catch}{Catch} uses new \doxylink{namespace_c_l_i}{CLI} parsing library (Clara)
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Users can now easily add new command line options to the final executable
\item This also leads to some changes in {\ttfamily \doxylink{class_catch_1_1_session}{Catch\+::\+Session}} interface
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item All parts of matchers can be removed from a TU by defining {\ttfamily CATCH\+\_\+\+CONFIG\+\_\+\+DISABLE\+\_\+\+MATCHERS}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item This can be used to somewhat speed up compilation times
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item An experimental implementation of {\ttfamily CATCH\+\_\+\+CONFIG\+\_\+\+DISABLE} has been added
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Inspired by Doctest\textquotesingle{}s {\ttfamily DOCTEST\+\_\+\+CONFIG\+\_\+\+DISABLE}
\item Useful for implementing tests in source files
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item ie for functions in anonymous namespaces
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Removes all assertions
\item Prevents {\ttfamily TEST\+\_\+\+CASE} registrations
\item Exception translators are not registered
\item Reporters are not registered
\item Listeners are not registered
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Reporters/\+Listeners are now notified of fatal errors
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item This means specific signals or structured exceptions
\item The Reporter/\+Listener interface provides default, empty, implementation to preserve backward compatibility
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Stringification of {\ttfamily std\+::chrono\+::duration} and {\ttfamily std\+::chrono\+::time\+\_\+point} is now supported
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Needs to be enabled by a per-\/file compile time configuration option
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Add {\ttfamily pkg-\/config} support to CMake install command
\end{DoxyItemize}

\doxysubsubsection*{Fixes}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Don\textquotesingle{}t use console colour if running in XCode
\item Explicit constructor in reporter base class
\item Swept out {\ttfamily -\/Wweak-\/vtables}, {\ttfamily -\/Wexit-\/time-\/destructors}, {\ttfamily -\/Wglobal-\/constructors} warnings
\item Compilation for Universal Windows \doxylink{namespace_platform}{Platform} (UWP) is supported
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item SEH handling and colorized output are disabled when compiling for UWP
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Implemented a workaround for {\ttfamily std\+::uncaught\+\_\+exception} issues in libcxxrt
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item These issues caused incorrect section traversals
\item The workaround is only partial, user\textquotesingle{}s test can still trigger the issue by using {\ttfamily throw;} to rethrow an exception
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Suppressed C4061 warning under MSVC
\end{DoxyItemize}

\doxysubsubsection*{Internal changes}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The development version now uses .cpp files instead of header files containing implementation.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item This makes partial rebuilds much faster during development
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item The expression decomposition layer has been rewritten
\item The evaluation layer has been rewritten
\item New library (Text\+Flow) is used for formatting text to output

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Previously the parentheses were missing and {\ttfamily x != y} would be expanded as {\ttfamily !x != x}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily Approx\+::\+Margin} is now inclusive (\#952)
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Previously it was meant and documented as inclusive, but the check itself wasn\textquotesingle{}t
\item This means that {\ttfamily REQUIRE( 0.\+25f == Approx( 0.\+0f ).margin( 0.\+25f ) )} passes, instead of fails

\doxysubsubsubsubsection*{Improvements}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily \+\_\+\+\_\+\+JETBRAINS\+\_\+\+IDE\+\_\+\+\_\+} macro handling is now CLion version specific (\#1017)
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item When CLion 2017.\+3 or newer is detected, {\ttfamily \+\_\+\+\_\+\+COUNTER\+\_\+\+\_\+} is used instead of
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Team\+City reporter now explicitly flushes output stream after each report (\#1057)
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item On some platforms, output from redirected streams would show up only after the tests finished running
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily Parse\+And\+Add\+Catch\+Tests} now can add test files as dependency to CMake configuration
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item This means you do not have to manually rerun CMake configuration step to detect new tests

\doxysubsubsubsubsection*{Fixes}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Truthy expressions are now reconstructed properly, not as booleans (\#914)
\item Various warnings are no longer erroneously suppressed in test files (files that include {\ttfamily catch.\+hpp}, but do not define {\ttfamily CATCH\+\_\+\+CONFIG\+\_\+\+MAIN} or {\ttfamily CATCH\+\_\+\+CONFIG\+\_\+\+RUNNER}) (\#871)
\item \doxylink{namespace_catch}{Catch} no longer fails to link when main is compiled as C++, but linked against Objective-\/C (\#855)
\item Fixed incorrect gcc version detection when deciding to use {\ttfamily \+\_\+\+\_\+\+COUNTER\+\_\+\+\_\+} (\#928)
\begin{DoxyItemize}

\item Unexpected exceptions are no longer ignored by default (\#885, \#887)
\end{DoxyItemize}

\doxysubsubsubsection*{1.\+9.\+0}

\doxysubsubsubsubsection*{Improvements and minor changes}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \doxylink{namespace_catch}{Catch} no longer attempts to ensure the exception type passed by user in {\ttfamily REQUIRE\+\_\+\+THROWS\+\_\+\+AS} is a constant reference.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item It was causing trouble when {\ttfamily REQUIRE\+\_\+\+THROWS\+\_\+\+AS} was used inside templated functions
\item This actually reverts changes made in v1.\+7.\+2
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item \doxylink{namespace_catch}{Catch}\textquotesingle{}s {\ttfamily Version} struct should no longer be double freed when multiple instances of \doxylink{namespace_catch}{Catch} tests are loaded into single program (\#858)
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item It is now a static variable in an inline function instead of being an {\ttfamily extern}ed struct.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Attempt to register invalid tag or tag alias now throws instead of calling {\ttfamily exit()}.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Because this happen before entering main, it still aborts execution
\item Further improvements to this are coming
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily CATCH\+\_\+\+CONFIG\+\_\+\+FAST\+\_\+\+COMPILE} now speeds-\/up compilation of {\ttfamily REQUIRE\texorpdfstring{$\ast$}{*}} assertions by further \texorpdfstring{$\sim$}{\string~}15\%.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The trade-\/off is disabling translation of unexpected exceptions into text.

\item When \doxylink{namespace_catch}{Catch} is compiled using C++11, {\ttfamily Approx} is now constructible with anything that can be explicitly converted to {\ttfamily double}.
\item Captured messages are now printed on unexpected exceptions

\doxysubsubsubsubsection*{Fixes\+:}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Clang\textquotesingle{}s {\ttfamily -\/Wexit-\/time-\/destructors} should be suppressed for \doxylink{namespace_catch}{Catch}\textquotesingle{}s internals
\item GCC\textquotesingle{}s {\ttfamily -\/Wparentheses} is now suppressed for all TU\textquotesingle{}s that include {\ttfamily catch.\+hpp}.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item This is functionally a revert of changes made in 1.\+8.\+0, where we tried using {\ttfamily \+\_\+\+Pragma} based suppression. This should have kept the suppression local to \doxylink{namespace_catch}{Catch}\textquotesingle{}s assertions, but bugs in GCC\textquotesingle{}s handling of {\ttfamily \+\_\+\+Pragma}s in C++ mode meant that it did not always work.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item You can now tell \doxylink{namespace_catch}{Catch} to use C++11-\/based check when checking whether a type can be streamed to output.

\doxysubsubsubsubsection*{Improvements and minor changes}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item TAP reporter now behaves as if {\ttfamily -\/s} was always set
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item This should be more consistent with the protocol desired behaviour.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Compact reporter now obeys {\ttfamily -\/d yes} argument (\#780)
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The format is "{}\+XXX.\+123 s\+: $<$section-\/name$>$"{} (3 decimal places are always present).
\item Before it did not report the durations at all.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item XML reporter now behaves the same way as Console reporter in regards to {\ttfamily INFO}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item This means it reports {\ttfamily INFO} messages on success, if output on success ({\ttfamily -\/s}) is enabled.
\item Previously it only reported {\ttfamily INFO} messages on failure.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily \doxylink{include_2catch_8hpp_aaf9fe43c53965ff8d94bbd522fd1fd7a}{CAPTURE(expr)}} now stringifies {\ttfamily expr} in the same way assertion macros do (\#639)
\item Listeners are now finally \href{event-listeners.md\#top}{\texttt{ documented}}.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Listeners provide a way to hook into events generated by running your tests, including start and end of run, every test case, every section and every assertion.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}

\doxysubsubsubsubsection*{Fixes\+:}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \doxylink{namespace_catch}{Catch} no longer attempts to reconstruct expression that led to a fatal error (\#810)

\end{DoxyItemize}
\item \doxylink{namespace_catch}{Catch} now provides {\ttfamily \doxylink{include_2catch_8hpp_a3c2341a3238242fdc02d33a1968bd1d2}{FAIL\+\_\+\+CHECK( ... )}} macro (\#765).
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Same as {\ttfamily \doxylink{gtest_8h_a3e26a8d27caa386ed0ea7ce9d5b7c4ed}{FAIL( ... )}}, but does not abort the test.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Functions like {\ttfamily fabs}, {\ttfamily tolower}, {\ttfamily memset}, {\ttfamily isalnum} are now used with {\ttfamily std\+:\+:} qualification (\#543).

Xml\+:

(technically the first two are breaking changes but are also fixes and arguably break few if any people)
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item C-\/escape control characters instead of XML encoding them (which requires XML 1.\+1)
\item Revert XML output to XML 1.\+0
\item Can provide stylesheet references by extending the XML reporter
\item Added description and tags attributes to XML Reporter
\item Tags are closed and the stream flushed more eagerly to avoid stdout interpolation
\end{DoxyItemize}

Other\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily REQUIRE\+\_\+\+THROWS\+\_\+\+AS} now catches exception by {\ttfamily const\&} and reports expected type
\item In {\ttfamily SECTION}s the file/ line is now of the {\ttfamily SECTION}. not the {\ttfamily TEST\+\_\+\+CASE}
\item Added std\+:\+: qualification to some functions from C stdlib
\item Removed use of RTTI ({\ttfamily dynamic\+\_\+cast}) that had crept back in
\item Silenced a few more warnings in different circumstances
\item Travis improvements
\end{DoxyItemize}

\item Fixed SEH-\/related compilation error under older Min\+GW compilers, by making Windows SEH handling opt-\/in for compilers other than MSVC.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item For specifics, look into the \href{configuration.md\#top}{\texttt{ documentation}}.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixed compilation error under Min\+GW caused by improper compiler detection.
\item Fixed XML reporter sometimes leaving an empty output file when a test ends with signal/structured exception.
\item Fixed XML reporter not reporting captured stdout/stderr.

\end{DoxyItemize}

\doxysubsubsubsection*{1.\+7.\+0}

\doxysubsubsubsubsection*{Features/ Changes\+:}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \doxylink{namespace_catch}{Catch} now runs significantly faster for passing tests
\begin{DoxyItemize}

\item Real world test using \href{https://github.com/nlohmann/json}{\texttt{ JSON for Modern C++}}\textquotesingle{}s test suite went from \texorpdfstring{$\sim$}{\string~}6m 25s to \texorpdfstring{$\sim$}{\string~}4m 14s.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item \doxylink{namespace_catch}{Catch} can now run specific sections within test cases.
\begin{DoxyItemize}

\end{DoxyItemize}
\item \doxylink{namespace_catch}{Catch} now supports SEH on Windows as well as signals on Linux.

\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Approx can be used to compare values against strong typedefs (available in C++11 mode only).
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Strong typedefs mean types that are explicitly convertible to double.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item CHECK macro no longer stops executing section if an exception happens.
\item Certain characters (space, tab, etc) are now pretty printed.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item This means that a `char c = ' \textquotesingle{}; REQUIRE(c == \textquotesingle{}\textbackslash{}t\textquotesingle{});{\ttfamily would be printed as}\textquotesingle{} \textquotesingle{} == \textquotesingle{}\textbackslash{}t\textquotesingle{}{\ttfamily , instead of} == 9\`{}.

 \doxysection*{Why do we need yet another C++ test framework?}

Good question. For C++ there are quite a number of established frameworks, including (but not limited to), \href{http://code.google.com/p/googletest/}{\texttt{ Google Test}}, \href{http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_49_0/libs/test/doc/html/index.html}{\texttt{ Boost.\+Test}}, \href{http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/cppunit/index.php?title=Main_Page}{\texttt{ Cpp\+Unit}}, \href{http://www.cute-test.com}{\texttt{ Cute}}, \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_unit_testing_frameworks\#C.2B.2B}{\texttt{ many, many more}}.

So what does \doxylink{namespace_catch}{Catch} bring to the party that differentiates it from these? Apart from a Catchy name, of course.

\doxysubsection*{Key Features}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Quick and Really easy to get started. Just download catch.\+hpp, {\ttfamily \#include} it and you\textquotesingle{}re away.
\item No external dependencies. As long as you can compile C++11 and have a C++ standard library available.
\item Write test cases as, self-\/registering, functions (or methods, if you prefer).
\item Divide test cases into sections, each of which is run in isolation (eliminates the need for fixtures).
\item Use BDD-\/style Given-\/\+When-\/\+Then sections as well as traditional unit test cases.
\item Only one core assertion macro for comparisons. Standard C/\+C++ operators are used for the comparison -\/ yet the full expression is decomposed and lhs and rhs values are logged.
\item Tests are named using free-\/form strings -\/ no more couching names in legal identifiers.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\doxysubsection*{Other core features}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Tests can be tagged for easily running ad-\/hoc groups of tests.
\item Failures can (optionally) break into the debugger on Windows and Mac.
\item Output is through modular reporter objects. Basic textual and XML reporters are included. Custom reporters can easily be added.
\item JUnit xml output is supported for integration with third-\/party tools, such as CI servers.
\item \doxylink{struct_a}{A} default \doxylink{platform__timer__posix__test_8c_ae66f6b31b5ad750f1fe042a706a4e3d4}{main()} function is provided, but you can supply your own for complete control (e.\+g. integration into your own test runner GUI).
\item \doxylink{struct_a}{A} command line parser is provided and can still be used if you choose to provided your own \doxylink{platform__timer__posix__test_8c_ae66f6b31b5ad750f1fe042a706a4e3d4}{main()} function.
\item \doxylink{namespace_catch}{Catch} can test itself.
\item Alternative assertion macro(s) report failures but don\textquotesingle{}t abort the test case
\item Floating point tolerance comparisons are built in using an expressive Approx() syntax.
\item Internal and friendly macros are isolated so name clashes can be managed
\item Matchers

 \doxysection*{Commercial users of \doxylink{namespace_catch}{Catch}}

As well as \href{opensource-users.md\#top}{\texttt{ Open Source}} users \doxylink{namespace_catch}{Catch} is widely used within proprietary code bases too. Many organisations like to keep this information internal, and that\textquotesingle{}s fine, but if you\textquotesingle{}re more open it would be great if we could list the names of as many organisations as possible that use \doxylink{namespace_catch}{Catch} somewhere in their codebase. Enterprise environments often tend to be far more conservative in their tool adoption -\/ and being aware that other companies are using \doxylink{namespace_catch}{Catch} can ease the path in.

So if you are aware of \doxylink{namespace_catch}{Catch} usage in your organisation, and are fairly confident there is no issue with sharing this fact then please let us know -\/ either directly, via a PR or \href{https://github.com/philsquared/Catch/issues}{\texttt{ issue}}, or on the \href{https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups\#!forum/catch-forum}{\texttt{ forums}}.

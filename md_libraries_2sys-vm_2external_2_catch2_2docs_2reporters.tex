 \doxysection*{Reporters}

\doxylink{namespace_catch}{Catch} has a modular reporting system and comes bundled with a handful of useful reporters built in. You can also write your own reporters.

\doxysubsection*{Using different reporters}

The reporter to use can easily be controlled from the command line. To specify a reporter use \href{command-line.md\#choosing-a-reporter-to-use}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily -\/r} or {\ttfamily -\/-\/reporter}}}, followed by the name of the reporter, e.\+g.\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{-\/r\ xml}

\end{DoxyCode}


If you don\textquotesingle{}t specify a reporter then the console reporter is used by default. There are four reporters built in to the single include\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily console} writes as lines of text, formatted to a typical terminal width, with colours if a capable terminal is detected.
\item {\ttfamily compact} similar to {\ttfamily console} but optimised for minimal output -\/ each entry on one line
\item {\ttfamily junit} writes xml that corresponds to Ant\textquotesingle{}s \href{http://help.catchsoftware.com/display/ET/JUnit+Format}{\texttt{ junitreport}} target. Useful for build systems that understand Junit. Because of the way the junit format is structured the run must complete before anything is written.
\item {\ttfamily xml} writes an xml format tailored to \doxylink{namespace_catch}{Catch}. Unlike {\ttfamily junit} this is a streaming format so results are delivered progressively.
\end{DoxyItemize}

There are a few additional reporters, for specific build systems, in the \doxylink{namespace_catch}{Catch} repository (in {\ttfamily include\textbackslash{}reporters}) which you can {\ttfamily \#include} in your project if you would like to make use of them. Do this in one source file -\/ the same one you have {\ttfamily CATCH\+\_\+\+CONFIG\+\_\+\+MAIN} or {\ttfamily CATCH\+\_\+\+CONFIG\+\_\+\+RUNNER}.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily teamcity} writes the native, streaming, format that \href{https://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity/}{\texttt{ Team\+City}} understands. Use this when building as part of a Team\+City build to see results as they happen (\href{../examples/207-Rpt-TeamCityReporter.cpp}{\texttt{ code example}}).
\item {\ttfamily tap} writes in the TAP (\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_Anything_Protocol}{\texttt{ Test Anything Protocol}}) format.
\item {\ttfamily automake} writes in a format that correspond to \href{https://www.gnu.org/software/automake/manual/html_node/Log-files-generation-and-test-results-recording.html}{\texttt{ automake .trs}} files
\end{DoxyItemize}

You see what reporters are available from the command line by running with {\ttfamily -\/-\/list-\/reporters}.

By default all these reports are written to stdout, but can be redirected to a file with \href{command-line.md\#sending-output-to-a-file}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily -\/o} or {\ttfamily -\/-\/out}}}

\doxysubsection*{Writing your own reporter}

You can write your own custom reporter and register it with \doxylink{namespace_catch}{Catch}. At time of writing the interface is subject to some changes so is not, yet, documented here. If you are determined you shouldn\textquotesingle{}t have too much trouble working it out from the existing implementations -\/ but do keep in mind upcoming changes (these will be minor, simplifying, changes such as not needing to forward calls to the base class).

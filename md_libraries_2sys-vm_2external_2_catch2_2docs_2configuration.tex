\doxylink{namespace_catch}{Catch} is designed to "{}just work"{} as much as possible. For most people the only configuration needed is telling \doxylink{namespace_catch}{Catch} which source file should host all the implementation code ({\ttfamily CATCH\+\_\+\+CONFIG\+\_\+\+MAIN}).

Nonetheless there are still some occasions where finer control is needed. For these occasions \doxylink{namespace_catch}{Catch} exposes a set of macros for configuring how it is built.

\doxysubsection*{\doxylink{platform__timer__posix__test_8c_ae66f6b31b5ad750f1fe042a706a4e3d4}{main()}/ implementation}

\begin{DoxyVerb}CATCH_CONFIG_MAIN      // Designates this as implementation file and defines main()
CATCH_CONFIG_RUNNER    // Designates this as implementation file
\end{DoxyVerb}


Although \doxylink{namespace_catch}{Catch} is header only it still, internally, maintains a distinction between interface headers and headers that contain implementation. Only one source file in your test project should compile the implementation headers and this is controlled through the use of one of these macros -\/ one of these identifiers should be defined before including \doxylink{namespace_catch}{Catch} in {\itshape exactly one implementation file in your project}.

\doxysubsection*{Reporter / Listener interfaces}

\begin{DoxyVerb}CATCH_CONFIG_EXTERNAL_INTERFACES  // Brings in necessary headers for Reporter/Listener implementation
\end{DoxyVerb}


Brings in various parts of \doxylink{namespace_catch}{Catch} that are required for user defined Reporters and Listeners. This means that new Reporters and Listeners can be defined in this file as well as in the main file.

Implied by both {\ttfamily CATCH\+\_\+\+CONFIG\+\_\+\+MAIN} and {\ttfamily CATCH\+\_\+\+CONFIG\+\_\+\+RUNNER}.

\doxysubsection*{Prefixing \doxylink{namespace_catch}{Catch} macros}

\begin{DoxyVerb}CATCH_CONFIG_PREFIX_ALL
\end{DoxyVerb}


To keep test code clean and uncluttered \doxylink{namespace_catch}{Catch} uses short macro names (e.\+g. {\ttfamily TEST\+\_\+\+CASE} and {\ttfamily REQUIRE}). Occasionally these may conflict with identifiers from platform headers or the system under test. In this case the above identifier can be defined. This will cause all the \doxylink{namespace_catch}{Catch} user macros to be prefixed with {\ttfamily CATCH\+\_\+} (e.\+g. {\ttfamily CATCH\+\_\+\+TEST\+\_\+\+CASE} and {\ttfamily CATCH\+\_\+\+REQUIRE}).

\doxysubsection*{Terminal colour}

\begin{DoxyVerb}CATCH_CONFIG_COLOUR_NONE      // completely disables all text colouring
CATCH_CONFIG_COLOUR_WINDOWS   // forces the Win32 console API to be used
CATCH_CONFIG_COLOUR_ANSI      // forces ANSI colour codes to be used
\end{DoxyVerb}


Yes, I am English, so I will continue to spell "{}colour"{} with a \textquotesingle{}u\textquotesingle{}.

When sending output to the terminal, if it detects that it can, \doxylink{namespace_catch}{Catch} will use colourised text. On Windows the Win32 API, {\ttfamily Set\+Console\+Text\+Attribute}, is used. On POSIX systems ANSI colour escape codes are inserted into the stream.

For finer control you can define one of the above identifiers (these are mutually exclusive -\/ but that is not checked so may behave unexpectedly if you mix them)\+:

Note that when ANSI colour codes are used "{}unistd.\+h"{} must be includable -\/ along with a definition of {\ttfamily isatty()}

Typically you should place the {\ttfamily \#define} before \#including "{}catch.\+hpp"{} in your main source file -\/ but if you prefer you can define it for your whole project by whatever your IDE or build system provides for you to do so.

\doxysubsection*{Console width}

\begin{DoxyVerb}CATCH_CONFIG_CONSOLE_WIDTH = x // where x is a number
\end{DoxyVerb}


\doxylink{namespace_catch}{Catch} formats output intended for the console to fit within a fixed number of characters. This is especially important as indentation is used extensively and uncontrolled line wraps break this. By default a console width of 80 is assumed but this can be controlled by defining the above identifier to be a different value.

\doxysubsection*{stdout}

\begin{DoxyVerb}CATCH_CONFIG_NOSTDOUT
\end{DoxyVerb}


To support platforms that do not provide {\ttfamily std\+::cout}, {\ttfamily std\+::cerr} and {\ttfamily std\+::clog}, \doxylink{namespace_catch}{Catch} does not usem the directly, but rather calls {\ttfamily \doxylink{namespace_catch_a0179d453617ba2296f2baa99a49e7264}{Catch\+::cout}}, {\ttfamily \doxylink{namespace_catch_a54c1ce08041448d684ae8edc14162cd2}{Catch\+::cerr}} and {\ttfamily \doxylink{namespace_catch_a1b2213f54e4d31a659db49827e81856b}{Catch\+::clog}}. You can replace their implementation by defining {\ttfamily CATCH\+\_\+\+CONFIG\+\_\+\+NOSTDOUT} and implementing them yourself, their signatures are\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}std::ostream& cout();
std::ostream& cerr();
std::ostream& clog();
\end{DoxyVerb}


\href{../examples/231-Cfg-OutputStreams.cpp}{\texttt{ You can see an example of replacing these functions here.}}

\doxysubsection*{Fallback stringifier}

By default, when \doxylink{namespace_catch}{Catch}\textquotesingle{}s stringification machinery has to stringify a type that does not specialize {\ttfamily String\+Maker}, does not overload {\ttfamily operator\texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}\texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}}, is not an enumeration and is not a range, it uses {\ttfamily "{}\{?\}"{}}. This can be overridden by defining {\ttfamily CATCH\+\_\+\+CONFIG\+\_\+\+FALLBACK\+\_\+\+STRINGIFIER} to name of a function that should perform the stringification instead.

All types that do not provide {\ttfamily String\+Maker} specialization or {\ttfamily operator\texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}\texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}} overload will be sent to this function (this includes enums and ranges). The provided function must return {\ttfamily std\+::string} and must accept any type, e.\+g. via overloading.

{\itshape Note that if the provided function does not handle a type and this type requires to be stringified, the compilation will fail.}

\doxysubsection*{Default reporter}

\doxylink{namespace_catch}{Catch}\textquotesingle{}s default reporter can be changed by defining macro {\ttfamily CATCH\+\_\+\+CONFIG\+\_\+\+DEFAULT\+\_\+\+REPORTER} to string literal naming the desired default reporter.

This means that defining {\ttfamily CATCH\+\_\+\+CONFIG\+\_\+\+DEFAULT\+\_\+\+REPORTER} to {\ttfamily "{}console"{}} is equivalent with the out-\/of-\/the-\/box experience.

\doxysubsection*{C++11 toggles}

\begin{DoxyVerb}CATCH_CONFIG_CPP11_TO_STRING // Use `std::to_string`
\end{DoxyVerb}


Because we support platforms whose standard library does not contain {\ttfamily std\+::to\+\_\+string}, it is possible to force \doxylink{namespace_catch}{Catch} to use a workaround based on {\ttfamily std\+::stringstream}. On platforms other than Android, the default is to use {\ttfamily std\+::to\+\_\+string}. On Android, the default is to use the {\ttfamily stringstream} workaround. As always, it is possible to override \doxylink{namespace_catch}{Catch}\textquotesingle{}s selection, by defining either {\ttfamily CATCH\+\_\+\+CONFIG\+\_\+\+CPP11\+\_\+\+TO\+\_\+\+STRING} or {\ttfamily CATCH\+\_\+\+CONFIG\+\_\+\+NO\+\_\+\+CPP11\+\_\+\+TO\+\_\+\+STRING}.

\doxysubsection*{C++17 toggles}

\begin{DoxyVerb}CATCH_CONFIG_CPP17_UNCAUGHT_EXCEPTIONS  // Use std::uncaught_exceptions instead of std::uncaught_exception
CATCH_CONFIG_CPP17_STRING_VIEW          // Provide StringMaker specialization for std::string_view
CATCH_CONFIG_CPP17_VARIANT              // Override C++17 detection for CATCH_CONFIG_ENABLE_VARIANT_STRINGMAKER
\end{DoxyVerb}


\doxylink{namespace_catch}{Catch} contains basic compiler/standard detection and attempts to use some C++17 features whenever appropriate. This automatic detection can be manually overridden in both directions, that is, a feature can be enabled by defining the macro in the table above, and disabled by using {\ttfamily \+\_\+\+NO\+\_\+} in the macro, e.\+g. {\ttfamily CATCH\+\_\+\+CONFIG\+\_\+\+NO\+\_\+\+CPP17\+\_\+\+UNCAUGHT\+\_\+\+EXCEPTIONS}.

\doxysubsection*{Other toggles}

\begin{DoxyVerb}CATCH_CONFIG_COUNTER                    // Use __COUNTER__ to generate unique names for test cases
CATCH_CONFIG_WINDOWS_SEH                // Enable SEH handling on Windows
CATCH_CONFIG_FAST_COMPILE               // Sacrifices some (rather minor) features for compilation speed
CATCH_CONFIG_DISABLE_MATCHERS           // Do not compile Matchers in this compilation unit
CATCH_CONFIG_POSIX_SIGNALS              // Enable handling POSIX signals
CATCH_CONFIG_WINDOWS_CRTDBG             // Enable leak checking using Windows's CRT Debug Heap
CATCH_CONFIG_DISABLE_STRINGIFICATION    // Disable stringifying the original expression
CATCH_CONFIG_DISABLE                    // Disables assertions and test case registration
CATCH_CONFIG_WCHAR                      // Enables use of wchart_t
CATCH_CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL_REDIRECT      // Enables the new (experimental) way of capturing stdout/stderr
\end{DoxyVerb}


Currently \doxylink{namespace_catch}{Catch} enables {\ttfamily CATCH\+\_\+\+CONFIG\+\_\+\+WINDOWS\+\_\+\+SEH} only when compiled with MSVC, because some versions of Min\+GW do not have the necessary Win32 API support.

{\ttfamily CATCH\+\_\+\+CONFIG\+\_\+\+POSIX\+\_\+\+SIGNALS} is on by default, except when \doxylink{namespace_catch}{Catch} is compiled under {\ttfamily Cygwin}, where it is disabled by default (but can be force-\/enabled by defining {\ttfamily CATCH\+\_\+\+CONFIG\+\_\+\+POSIX\+\_\+\+SIGNALS}).

{\ttfamily CATCH\+\_\+\+CONFIG\+\_\+\+WINDOWS\+\_\+\+CRTDBG} is off by default. If enabled, Windows\textquotesingle{}s CRT is used to check for memory leaks, and displays them after the tests finish running.

{\ttfamily CATCH\+\_\+\+CONFIG\+\_\+\+WCHAR} is on by default, but can be disabled. Currently it is only used in support for DJGPP cross-\/compiler.

With the exception of {\ttfamily CATCH\+\_\+\+CONFIG\+\_\+\+EXPERIMENTAL\+\_\+\+REDIRECT}, these toggles can be disabled by using {\ttfamily \+\_\+\+NO\+\_\+} form of the toggle, e.\+g. {\ttfamily CATCH\+\_\+\+CONFIG\+\_\+\+NO\+\_\+\+WINDOWS\+\_\+\+SEH}.

\doxysubsubsection*{{\ttfamily CATCH\+\_\+\+CONFIG\+\_\+\+FAST\+\_\+\+COMPILE}}

This compile-\/time flag speeds up compilation of assertion macros by \texorpdfstring{$\sim$}{\string~}20\%, by disabling the generation of assertion-\/local try-\/catch blocks for non-\/exception family of assertion macros (\{{\ttfamily REQUIRE},{\ttfamily CHECK}\}\{\`{}{\ttfamily ,}\+\_\+\+FALSE{\ttfamily ,}\+\_\+\+THAT\`{}\}). This disables translation of exceptions thrown under these assertions, but should not lead to false negatives.

{\ttfamily CATCH\+\_\+\+CONFIG\+\_\+\+FAST\+\_\+\+COMPILE} has to be either defined, or not defined, in all translation units that are linked into single test binary.

\doxysubsubsection*{{\ttfamily CATCH\+\_\+\+CONFIG\+\_\+\+DISABLE\+\_\+\+MATCHERS}}

When {\ttfamily CATCH\+\_\+\+CONFIG\+\_\+\+DISABLE\+\_\+\+MATCHERS} is defined, all mentions of \doxylink{namespace_catch}{Catch}\textquotesingle{}s Matchers are ifdef-\/ed away from the translation unit. Doing so will speed up compilation of that TU.

{\itshape Note\+: If you define {\ttfamily CATCH\+\_\+\+CONFIG\+\_\+\+DISABLE\+\_\+\+MATCHERS} in the same file as \doxylink{namespace_catch}{Catch}\textquotesingle{}s main is implemented, your test executable will fail to link if you use Matchers anywhere.}

\doxysubsubsection*{{\ttfamily CATCH\+\_\+\+CONFIG\+\_\+\+DISABLE\+\_\+\+STRINGIFICATION}}

This toggle enables a workaround for VS 2017 bug. For details see \href{limitations.md\#visual-studio-2017----raw-string-literal-in-assert-fails-to-compile}{\texttt{ known limitations}}.

\doxysubsubsection*{{\ttfamily CATCH\+\_\+\+CONFIG\+\_\+\+DISABLE}}

This toggle removes most of \doxylink{namespace_catch}{Catch} from given file. This means that {\ttfamily TEST\+\_\+\+CASE}s are not registered and assertions are turned into no-\/ops. Useful for keeping tests within implementation files (ie for functions with internal linkage), instead of in external files.

This feature is considered experimental and might change at any point.

{\itshape Inspired by Doctest\textquotesingle{}s {\ttfamily DOCTEST\+\_\+\+CONFIG\+\_\+\+DISABLE}}

\doxysubsection*{Windows header clutter}

On Windows \doxylink{namespace_catch}{Catch} includes {\ttfamily windows.\+h}. To minimize global namespace clutter in the implementation file, it defines {\ttfamily NOMINMAX} and {\ttfamily WIN32\+\_\+\+LEAN\+\_\+\+AND\+\_\+\+MEAN} before including it. You can control this behaviour via two macros\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}CATCH_CONFIG_NO_NOMINMAX            // Stops Catch from using NOMINMAX macro 
CATCH_CONFIG_NO_WIN32_LEAN_AND_MEAN // Stops Catch from using WIN32_LEAN_AND_MEAN macro
\end{DoxyVerb}


\doxysubsection*{Enabling stringification}

By default, \doxylink{namespace_catch}{Catch} does not stringify some types from the standard library. This is done to avoid dragging in various standard library headers by default. However, \doxylink{namespace_catch}{Catch} does contain these and can be configured to provide them, using these macros\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}CATCH_CONFIG_ENABLE_PAIR_STRINGMAKER     // Provide StringMaker specialization for std::pair
CATCH_CONFIG_ENABLE_TUPLE_STRINGMAKER    // Provide StringMaker specialization for std::tuple
CATCH_CONFIG_ENABLE_CHRONO_STRINGMAKER   // Provide StringMaker specialization for std::chrono::duration, std::chrono::timepoint
CATCH_CONFIG_ENABLE_VARIANT_STRINGMAKER  // Provide StringMaker specialization for std::variant, std::monostate (on C++17)
CATCH_CONFIG_ENABLE_OPTIONAL_STRINGMAKER // Provide StringMaker specialization for std::optional (on C++17)
CATCH_CONFIG_ENABLE_ALL_STRINGMAKERS     // Defines all of the above
\end{DoxyVerb}


\doxysubsection*{Disabling exceptions}

By default, Catch2 uses exceptions to signal errors and to abort tests when an assertion from the {\ttfamily REQUIRE} family of assertions fails. We also provide an experimental support for disabling exceptions. Catch2 should automatically detect when it is compiled with exceptions disabled, but it can be forced to compile without exceptions by defining \begin{DoxyVerb}CATCH_CONFIG_DISABLE_EXCEPTIONS
\end{DoxyVerb}


Note that when using Catch2 without exceptions, there are 2 major limitations\+:

1) If there is an error that would normally be signalled by an exception, the exception\textquotesingle{}s message will instead be written to {\ttfamily \doxylink{namespace_catch_a54c1ce08041448d684ae8edc14162cd2}{Catch\+::cerr}} and {\ttfamily std\+::terminate} will be called. 2) If an assertion from the {\ttfamily REQUIRE} family of macros fails, {\ttfamily std\+::terminate} will be called after the active reporter returns.

There is also a customization point for the exact behaviour of what happens instead of exception being thrown. To use it, define \begin{DoxyVerb}CATCH_CONFIG_DISABLE_EXCEPTIONS_CUSTOM_HANDLER
\end{DoxyVerb}


and provide a definition for this function\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{keyword}{namespace\ }\mbox{\hyperlink{namespace_catch}{Catch}}\ \{}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \ \ [[noreturn]]}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \ \ \textcolor{keywordtype}{void}\ \mbox{\hyperlink{namespace_catch_a3cbceeab9252d1b752f66a2826e92548}{throw\_exception}}(std::exception\ \textcolor{keyword}{const}\&);}
\DoxyCodeLine{\}}

\end{DoxyCode}

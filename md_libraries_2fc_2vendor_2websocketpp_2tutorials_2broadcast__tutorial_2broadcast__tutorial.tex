This tutorial will dig into some more nitty gritty details on how to build high scalability, high performance websocket servers for broadcast like workflows.

Will go into features like\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item minimizing work done in handlers
\item using asio thread pool mode
\item teaming multiple endpoints
\item setting accept queue depth
\item tuning compile time buffer sizes
\item prepared messages
\item flow control
\item basic operating system level tuning, particularly increasing file descriptor limits.
\item measuring performance with wsperf / autobahn
\item tuning permessage-\/deflate compression settings
